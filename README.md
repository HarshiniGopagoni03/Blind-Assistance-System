Blind Assistance System

📌 Overview

The Blind Assistance System is an AI-powered project designed to assist visually impaired individuals by detecting objects and providing real-time audio feedback. The system leverages computer vision and speech processing to enhance accessibility and independence.

🚀 Features

Real-time Object Detection – Identifies objects in the environment.

Voice Feedback – Provides audio descriptions of detected objects.

Face Recognition – Identifies familiar faces (if implemented).

Obstacle Detection – Alerts users about nearby obstacle.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

OpenCV – Image processing & object detection

TensorFlow/Keras – Deep learning for recognition

Text-to-Speech (TTS) API – Converts text to voice feedback

YOLO  – Object detection models
